### Tech used

While working on Race and Crosswords, we learned and used a lot of amazing tech including :

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Angular 5](https://angular.io)

In order to get the words and their definitions we used the [DataMuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/)

### Race

The race is in itself pretty simple... It's a car race.

The following where implemented for the race:

* Map creation (in admin section)
* collision between the cars and the off-road
* Basic AI
* Drift Mechanic
* Day/Night Mechanic
* FancyMode (enables shadows and more)
* Multiple camera types (Top, third, hood, etc...)
