"Makisupa" is the 25th free font from Rich Gast. 

It was originally created on 12/13/98.

Version 2.0 was completed on 8/01/99. This version both updates the
copyright information from DarkSide Productions to GreyWolf WebWorks
and makes the font embeddable.

GreyWolf WebWorks Free Fonts (and versions previously released as
DarkSide's Free Fonts) are FREE for personal use. They do, however,
remain the copyrighted property of Rich Gast and GreyWolf WebWorks.
They are not in the public domain.

Commercial use in any manner, including (but not limited to) use in
product, service or corporate logo design, inclusion in any software,
archive, collection or library for distribution to the public which
either directly or indirectly generates income for the distributor
requires written permission from the author and copyright holder,
who is specifically identified as:

Commercial ventures granted permission to include any GreyWolf Free
Font in their software, archive, library or collection will, if they
so request, be provided with new font files at no charge in which the
version specifically identifies them as a licensed user. In this
manner, the author and copyright holder of the fonts can best retain
control of the type of product/company with which his fonts are to be
associated.

Commercial ventures who include any GreyWolf Free Font in any manner
described above without receiving written permission from the author
and copyright holder will be subject to any and all legal remedies
available to the copyright holder.

All GreyWolf Free Fonts may be redistributed via FREE web sites,
e-mail, newsgroups and bulletin boards, as long as the original zip
file is kept intact and unaltered, including the accompanying text
file(s). If you wish to include them on a free web site, please just
ask in advance.

NOTE TO PERSONAL USERS: Maybe, just maybe, you'll make a fortune using
this font in some manner. If you do, all I ask is that you remember me
with a token of your appreciation. Any modest amount (at least $1 and
not to exceed $1,000,000) would be an appropriate gesture for my
contribution to your monumental financial success. Hey! I can dream!

The character set includes:

All Upper and Lower case letters and numbers.
The vast majority of punctuation and international characters.

The name "Makisupa" comes from an aspiring cartoonist, Kevin Jameson,
who scanned the characters and requested that I make a font of them.
KJ says it's the title of a Phish song, a fact I can neither confirm
nor deny....I'm not a Phish fan. Gimme Pink Floyd, and I'm happy.
